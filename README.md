# AliPAPA
Simple e-commerce demo website created using express js.  
Couldn't scrape from amazon even after using puppeteer because of product information not being present in the html so I went with ebay instead. Product name, price and image are scraped from the product link before added to the html. All the scraping is happening in the server side that's why it takes a long time to load the page.

## Stuffs Used
- Express.js
- MySQL(xampp)
- ejs templatig engine
- request library for getting the html
- cheerio for scraping
